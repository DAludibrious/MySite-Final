⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅

I like what I do.

I started my career in technology as a United States Marine. My expertise is in telecommunications and information security. More specifically, I worked in cryptographic key management and radio transmission as a leader and manager. I was able to travel extensively and work in a variety of challenging, austere environments. To say the least, it was an exciting time. To stay busy I continue to challenge myself personally and professionally.                       

After ending active service I completed a Master of Science in Information Technology. At the same time, I worked as a technical support engineer for Honeywell Intelligrated. The technology I worked with was software and hardware designed for voice-enabled distribution center automation. I gained valuable experience in enterprise application support and furthered my understanding of wireless devices. I began business school near the end of this role and started looking for something more challenging.               

I am presently an IT Auditor with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. This role allows me to evaluate technology across the organization. I assess and provide recommendations to senior management on physical, business, and financial controls. My day-to-day responsibilities include collecting and analyzing data to support internal controls. The software I work with includes vulnerability scanners, various databases, and enterprise applications used for financial transactions. What I like about this position is that each audit is different. I get to work with new technology and business unit every time.
